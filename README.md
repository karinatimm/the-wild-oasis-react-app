# The Wild Oasis

**The Wild Oasis** is a full-stack application designed to manage hotel operations for boutique cabins or rooms. Built with modern technologies, this application allows property managers to efficiently oversee bookings, guests, and cabins, all through a user-friendly interface. It serves as an internal back-office tool, streamlining workflows and enhancing guest experiences.

This project was completed by me as part of the course "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) on the Udemy educational platform.
